# Cosign

Cosign is a full stack social media platform built with **Django (web and API)** and **React Native (mobile)**, designed to reimagine online interaction and entertainment in a way that’s **healthier, safer, and more community driven** over the long term.

Instead of infinite feeds and engagement maximizing algorithms, Cosign is inspired by apps like **BeReal** and earlier eras of **Instagram/Facebook**, emphasizing **authentic community, comradery, and intentional sharing** as opposed to addiction and rivalry.

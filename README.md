# CoSign

Cosign is a full stack social media platform built on Django for web use and React Native on mobile to reimagine online interactions and entertainment to be healthier and safer for users long term. Most social media platforms use abusive algorithms to hook users into staying on their application, becoming addicted to the feeling of infinite content. Inspired by the mobile app BeReal and by previous versions of Instagram and Facebook, Cosign invites users to a social media that truly has community and comradery as opposed to addiction and rivalry.
